## Description: Solution DRIVE- NNET
##              the neural network is based on the result from the drive-fuzzy

NNET
  - This nnet learns the behavious recorded by the fuzzy logic.
  - Makedataset.m will concatains all .mat inside data into one .mat file under dataset. 
  - torcs.net and torcs-scale-params.mat are the neural net files.
