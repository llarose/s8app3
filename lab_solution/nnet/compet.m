## usage: A = compet(N)
##
## Competition operator that selects only the highest-valued dimension for 
## a vector or matrix (applied row-wise). The function returns a binary mask.
## This is useful in neural network applications to select the strongest output 
## neuron (set value as 1) and supress the activities of the other 
## neurons (set values as 0).
##
## Input:
## - N, a single row vector. If a matrix is provided, the thresholding 
##   is performed independently for each row.
##
## Output:
##
## - A, a binary vector or matrix of the same dimension as N.
##
## Example:
##
## n = [1,2,3; 
##      6,5,4; 
##      7,9,8];
## a = compet(n)
## ans =
##    0   0   1
##    1   0   0
##    0   1   0
function a = compet(n)
  n = n';
  a = zeros(size(n));
  a(find(n == repmat(max(n),size(n,1),1))) = 1;
  a = a';
endfunction
